# KSP-Orbital-Decay-
Version 0.0.1
This Github version is for anyone to suggest/make changes to the existing code so that a full release can be produced faster.

The new features needing to be implimented are:

- A code cleanup 
- Resource tracking and removal for active (packed) and background vessels
- Enhancements to the UI (A vertical slider, nicer looks etc.) 
- Accurate estimated times until deorbit
- New exponential decay formula based on the vessel size, mass and the reference body size, gravity, atmosphere and orbit height.

Note: I have a separate version (V0.0.2) which fixes some EVA bugs, I will merge this version with my own version prior to release. 

Thanks for any help in advance guys! 
:)
